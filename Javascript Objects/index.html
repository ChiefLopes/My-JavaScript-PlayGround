                    There are eight data types in JavaScript. <br>
                    Seven of them are called ‚Äúprimitive‚Äù, because their values contain only a single thing <br>
                    (be it a string or a number or whatever).

                    In JavaScript, objects penetrate almost every aspect of the language. <br>
                    So we must understand them first before going in-depth anywhere else. <br>

                    can be anything.
