                    There are eight data types in JavaScript. <br>
                    Seven of them are called “primitive”, because their values contain only a single thing <br>
                    (be it a string or a number or whatever).

                <h3>Contrast, objects are used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities.
                    <br>
                    In JavaScript, objects penetrate almost every aspect of the language. <br>
                    So we must understand them first before going in-depth anywhere else. <br>

                    A property is a “key: value” pair, where key is a string (also called a “property name”), and value
                    can be anything.

                    add/remove a
                    file. <br><br>

                <h3>Creating a JavaScript Object </h3>
                With JavaScript, you can define and create your own objects.

                There are different ways to create new objects:

                Create a single object, using an object literal.
                Create a single object, with the keyword new.
                Define an object constructor, and then create objects of the constructed type.
                Create an object using Object.create().
