            <h3>There are eight data types in JavaScript. <br>
                Seven of them are called “primitive”, because their values contain only a single thing <br>
                (be it a string or a number or whatever). <br> </h3>
            
            <h3>Contrast, objects are used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities. <br>
                In JavaScript, objects penetrate almost every aspect of the language. <br>
                So we must understand them first before going in-depth anywhere else. <br></h3>
            
            <h3>An object can be created with figure brackets {…} with an optional list of properties. <br>
                A property is a “key: value” pair, where key is a string (also called a “property name”), and value can be anything.
            </h3>
            
            <h3>We can imagine an object as a cabinet with signed files. <br>
                Every piece of data is stored in its file by the key. <br> It’s easy to find a file by its name or add/remove a
                file. <br><br>
                * In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.</h3>
